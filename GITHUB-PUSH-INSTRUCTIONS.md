### Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name and select scopes: `repo` (full control)
   - Copy the token

2. **Push using the token:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/CloudXploit/AppCM.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Using SSH Key

1. **Generate SSH key (if you don't have one):**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   - Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key" and paste

3. **Change remote to SSH:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:CloudXploit/AppCM.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

1. **Install GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install gh
   ```

2. **Authenticate and push:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 4: Manual Push Steps

If you prefer to push from your local machine:

1. **Copy the entire project folder to your local machine**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
