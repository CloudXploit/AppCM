## Campaign 2: Feature Highlight Series - AI Intelligence

**Subject Line:** How AI Can Predict Your Next Content Manager Outage

**Email Body:**

---

Hi [First Name],

What if you could know about Content Manager issues **3 days before they happen?**

With CM Diagnostics 2.0's AI-powered predictive analytics, you can.

### Here's How It Works:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Our ML algorithms analyze millions of data points to identify patterns that precede issues

2. **Anomaly Detection**: Instantly spot deviations from normal behavior before they become problems

3. **Predictive Alerts**: Receive warnings days in advance with specific remediation steps

### Real Example:

Last month, one of our customers avoided a major outage during their busiest season. CM Diagnostics predicted a storage capacity issue 5 days in advance, allowing them to:
- Add storage before hitting the limit
- Avoid any downtime
- Save an estimated $500,000 in lost productivity
