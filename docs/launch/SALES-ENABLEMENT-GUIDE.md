### Common Objections and Responses

#### "We already have monitoring tools"
**Response**: "That's great! CM Diagnostics complements your existing tools by providing Content Manager-specific intelligence they can't offer. Our customers typically keep their infrastructure monitoring while adding CM Diagnostics for deep CM insights. Would you like to see how we integrate with [their tool]?"

#### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: "I understand budget is important. Let's calculate your current costs: How many hours per week does your team spend on CM issues? What's the hourly cost of downtime? Our average customer saves $200K annually through reduced downtime and operational efficiency. Should we run an ROI analysis for your environment?"

#### "We don't have time to implement another tool"
**Response**: "That's exactly why we designed CM Diagnostics for rapid deployment. Unlike generic tools that take weeks to configure, we can have you monitoring your CM environment in under 30 minutes. Plus, our auto-discovery finds and configures everything automatically. Can I show you a 5-minute deployment demo?"

#### "Our CM environment is too complex/unique"
**Response**: "Complex environments actually benefit the most from CM Diagnostics. We support all CM versions from 9.4 to 25.2, including mixed-version environments. Our AI learns your specific patterns and provides customized insights. Some of our largest customers have 50+ CM instances. What specific complexities are you concerned about?"

#### "We need to evaluate other options"
**Response**: "Absolutely, you should evaluate all options. To help with your evaluation, we offer a 30-day free trial with your actual environment. This lets you compare real results, not just features. What criteria are most important in your evaluation?"
