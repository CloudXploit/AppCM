## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Models

```typescript
// Core remediation models
interface RemediationAction {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: ActionCategory;
  riskLevel: RiskLevel;
  requiredApprovals: number;
  parameters: ActionParameter[];
  preConditions: Condition[];
  postConditions: Condition[];
}

interface RemediationRequest {
  id: string;
  diagnosticResultId: string;
  actions: RemediationAction[];
  status: RemediationStatus;
  approvals: Approval[];
  impactAnalysis: ImpactAnalysis;
  executionPlan: ExecutionPlan;
}

interface Snapshot {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: SnapshotType;
  data: any;
  checksum: string;
  expiresAt: Date;
}
```

### API Design

```graphql
type Mutation {
  # Create remediation request
  createRemediationRequest(
    diagnosticResultId: ID!
    actionIds: [ID!]!
  ): RemediationRequest!
  
  # Approve remediation
  approveRemediation(
    requestId: ID!
    comment: String
  ): RemediationRequest!
  
  # Execute remediation
  executeRemediation(
    requestId: ID!
    options: ExecutionOptions
  ): RemediationExecution!
  
  # Rollback remediation
  rollbackRemediation(
    executionId: ID!
    reason: String!
  ): RollbackResult!
}

type Subscription {
  remediationProgress(executionId: ID!): RemediationProgress!
}
```
