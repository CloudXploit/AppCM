# User Interface & Experience Implementation Plan
## Content Manager Diagnostic & Auto-Remediation Platform

### Executive Summary
This plan outlines the implementation strategy for creating an intuitive, powerful, and modern user interface for the Content Manager Diagnostic platform. The UI will support all diagnostic features while maintaining simplicity and excellent user experience across all devices.

### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: Every interface element should have a clear purpose
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Users should see immediate responses to their actions
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show advanced features only when needed
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
5. **Performance**: Sub-2 second load times for all views

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
