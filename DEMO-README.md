# CM Diagnostics - Demo Application

## üöÄ Quick Start

We've created multiple ways to run the demo application:

### Option 1: Standalone HTML Demo (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to see the application in action without any dependencies:

```bash
# Run the demo server
./run-demo.sh

# Or open directly in your browser
# Open the file: standalone-demo.html
```

The standalone demo shows:
- Landing page with feature overview
- Simulated connection to CM 23.4
- Dashboard with multiple tabs:
  - **Overview**: System stats and status
  - **Diagnostics**: Run scans and see auto-fix options
  - **Users**: Active user management
  - **Performance**: Resource usage and metrics

### Option 2: Full Next.js Application

If you want to run the full application:

```bash
# Install dependencies (may have some warnings)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```
