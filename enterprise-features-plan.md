   - Compliance audit pass rates

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Performance degradation with scale
   - Data isolation failures
   - Integration complexity

2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Comprehensive testing at scale
   - Security review at each phase
   - Incremental rollout approach
