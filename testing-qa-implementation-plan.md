# Testing & Quality Assurance Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance strategy for the Content Manager Diagnostic & Auto-Remediation Platform. Our goal is to ensure 99.99% reliability, maintain code quality above 90% coverage, and deliver a bug-free experience across all supported Content Manager versions (9.4 through 25.2).

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Integrate testing early in the development cycle
2. **Test Pyramid Approach**: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests
3. **Continuous Testing**: Automated tests run on every commit
4. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on critical user paths and high-risk areas
5. **Data-Driven Testing**: Use real-world scenarios and edge cases

## Testing Strategy Overview

### Test Types Distribution
- **Unit Tests**: 60% (Fast, isolated component testing)
- **Integration Tests**: 25% (API and service integration)
- **E2E Tests**: 10% (Critical user journeys)
- **Performance Tests**: 5% (Load and stress testing)
